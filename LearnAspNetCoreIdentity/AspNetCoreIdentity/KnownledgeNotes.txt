4 Essentials Parts:
	- UI: Identity.UI
	- Functionalities: Identity
	- Data Store: Identity.EntityFrameworkCore
	- Actual Database (Ex: SQL Server) : EntityFrameworkCore.Design; EntityFrameworkCore.Tools

In AspnetCoreIdentity theres some main services:
	- SigninManager: Help to verify credentials and generating security context and does Authentication
		- For Authorization, we still need to create our own custom policy and IAuthorizationHandler if needed. 
		By default It's handled by default generic AuthorizationHandler for basic by Role
	- UserManager: help us to get all user information in the database

HOW 2FA Through Email WORKS:

	- 1 User send first factor authentication is username/password to server. Server audit success then create a code
	- 2 The code will be saved into identity cookie authentication and send back to the browser. Also send the code to the email
	- 3 User will check the code in email and send it to the server. Server will compare it with the saved code in identity cookie auth

HOW AUTHENTICATOR APP WORKS AS MFA (Multi Factor Authentication)
	- 1 Login in to the app is the first factor
	- 2 Configure the app to support MFA, then it will generate a security key for a specific user and save it
	- 3 Enter the key into your authenticator app on the mobile device, it will have a copy of the security key (enter manually or by QR code)
	- 4 The mobile app will take the current universal time period (every 30s calculated from the 0 start of universal time, just like a clock), so both side have the same universal time, take hasing algorithm with the key to generate a hash value (usually a 6 digit numbers)
	- 5 The hash value, called code will be send to the application. The application use the same saved security key + current universal time period (every 30s calculated from the 0 start of universal time, just like a clock) to generate the second hash value
	to compare two code must be equal.


An authentication challenge is invoked by Authorization when an unauthenticated user requests an endpoint that requires authentication. 
An authentication challenge is issued, for example, when an anonymous user requests a restricted resource or clicks on a login link. 
Authorization invokes a challenge using the specified authentication scheme(s), or the default if none is specified. See HttpContext.ChallengeAsync. 
Authentication challenge examples include:
	- A cookie authentication scheme redirecting the user to a login page. A JWT bearer scheme returning a 401 result with a www-authenticate: bearer header.
	- A challenge action should let the user know what authentication mechanism to use to access the requested resource.
